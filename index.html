<h3>Now Online with CSS Style</h3>

<h6>9th September 2019</h6>

<p>I am now officially online thanks to the free web host <a href="https://freewha.com/" target="_blank">www.freewha.com</a>, I chose this because it's 
completely
free and it allows me to upload my own HTML and CSS files from notepad which I feel is a good way to start when you want to learn coding a 
website
completely from scratch. I found it quite overwhelming to understand the difference between buying a domain name, choosing a web host, and then 

choosing a platform like Wordpress or Wix. So, I've started like this for simplicities sake, and it works! I chose to buy my own domain name from

<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">www.namecheap.com</a>, after a bit of research it seems that it's advisable to buy your domain name
from a separate
provider to you web host or platform so that it's easily transferable in the future. <br><br>I've continued my learning on Code Academy 
and have actually got through the HTML basics quite fast and have started to learn some CSS. My website is
still far from sexy, but I think you'll it's 
looking slightly more polished than last week. Next up is understanding GitHub and how to start integrating
into the coding community. There's no point 
in having a website if no one can find it. As before you can see my progress screenshot below and see you next week!

<h3>The Start of the Journey</h3>

<h6>1st September 2019</h6>

<p>Welcome to my first blog post! From just a few hours on Code Academy (<a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">www.codecademy.com</a>) 
I've started teaching myself HTML 
and have set up this very basic website. I like HTML from
what I've seen so far, it's very basic to start with so it's 
easy going for a complete beginner. You also get to see results very quickly, it's quite satisfying
constantly clicking refresh in your browser to see if 
what you've coded has worked or not. I think it's also a great way to record your journey. The aim for me
here is to share and document my progress through 
this self teaching journey. So, I've grabbed a screenshot of what my website currently looks like, beautiful 
isn't it? Well it's just a start. Hopefully 
over the weeks and months you will be able to see my website progress into something that looks professional and
beautiful. But first, I need to get this 
website online, I'll keep you posted in my next blog entry when I work out how to do it! Bye for now.
