<h3>What is Architect + Architect?</h3>
<p>Architect + Architect is my mission to migrate from Architect to Software Architect. I am currently an architect with 5+ years of experience in the industry,
and have decided to focus on a career change into programming. Programming is a completely new world for me, but
I believe that bringing together skills from two very different disciplines could create great results. Architects 
are good problem solvers and spatial thinkers, often having a broad range of social, environmental, technical,
and design skills in order to realise a building project. I am hoping that translating these skills into programming 
will make me into someone who can think outside the box. I enjoy a challenge and am always excited by the possibility
to create and innovate. As an architect I am trained to have a good eye for design and have the patients to persist until
the best possible solution is found. I have been told that programming requires a lot of patience, so welcome to my website
where I will document my journey and all the pitfalls along the way.</p>

<p>I am starting by teaching myself with as many free online resources as possible, starting with Code Academy and 
Free Code Camp. I've already listening to most the podcasts on Free Code Camp, which are extremely inspiring. Alongside 
the training resources I will be developing this blog website to put my learning into action and hopefully give some guidance
to people who are aspiring to do the same.
